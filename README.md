## About
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and constructing effective prompts for LLMs. The goal of prompt engineering is to provide the LLM with the necessary information and context to generate accurate and relevant responses. **MEDPrompt** is a user contributed collection of prompts for medical applications.

## Design
MEDPrompt's philosophy is that application logic shouldn’t make the prompt engineer's job difficult. We use [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) as a template engine.

## Usage
